## Reporting a Vulnerability

I take security seriously. If you discover a vulnerability, I appreciate your help in disclosing it to me in a responsible manner. Please follow these guidelines when reporting security vulnerabilities:

1. **Privately Disclose**: Please avoid publicly disclosing the vulnerability until I have had a chance to address it. Instead, report it to me privately.

2. **Provide Details**: When reporting a vulnerability, please provide me with sufficient details to understand and reproduce the issue. Include information such as the device you're running the app on, the version of Android you're using, the version of the app you're using, and a detailed description of the vulnerability.

3. **Responsible Disclosure**: Allow me a reasonable amount of time to address the vulnerability before disclosing it publicly.

We appreciate your efforts in helping me maintain the security of NextDNS Manager. Thank you for your cooperation.
