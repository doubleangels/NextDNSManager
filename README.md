# About

NextDNS Manager is an Android application that simplifies the management of your [NextDNS](https://nextdns.io) configuration. NextDNS is a cloud-based DNS filter and firewall that protects your home, family, and privacy online. With NextDNS Manager, you can easily control your NextDNS settings and ensure a safer and more secure online experience.

NextDNS Manager can be installed on any Android phone or tablet running Android 9+.

**NextDNS Manager is a completely open-source project with no official ties to NextDNS.**

# Features:

- **Intuitive Interface**: NextDNS Manager provides a user-friendly interface that allows you to manage your NextDNS settings with ease. The interface also includes Material You styling, automatic dark mode, as well as a dynamic/themed icon. The application also supports 14 languages!

- **Configuration Management**: You can configure your NextDNS settings, including filtering modes, blocklists, and whitelists.

- **Real-time Statistics**: Get insights into your DNS queries, blocked requests, and security events in real-time.

- **Security and Privacy**: Enhance your online security and privacy by leveraging NextDNS' filtering capabilities.

- **Easy Installation**: You can download and install NextDNS Manager from the Google Play Store, F-Droid, or directly from GitHub, providing multiple installation options.

# Installation

## Which installation method should I use?

Which app you should use depends on your privacy preferences and how often you wish to receive updates:

- If you are able to use Google Play, use it.
- If you're not able to use Google Play, sideload an APK from this repository.
- If neither of these options work for you, install the app from F-Droid.

For each build ("version") of the app, there are timelines for when the build will be available, so methods with longer timelines will result in longer wait times for updates.

|                  | Google Play   | Sideloaded APK | F-Droid       |
| ---------------- | ------------- | -------------- | ------------- |
| **Availability** | A few minutes | A few minutes  | Up to 14 days |

F-Droid takes much longer than any of the other methods because they have a human involved in the process, each app is signed by a human on a computer that is air-gapped (not connected to the internet).
